In this set of examples, you can see the progression from a single-threaded twitter poller to a pre-forked, distributed twitter engine of sorts.

The modules of interest being used:
* Net::Twitter
* TheSchwartz::Moosified
* Parallel::ForkManager

ex1: a simple Net::Twitter poller, plain and simple

ex2: polling is scheduled with TheSchwartz

ex3: processing of poll results is done with Acme::LOLCAT

ex4: pre-forked pollers (Parallel::ForkManager)
